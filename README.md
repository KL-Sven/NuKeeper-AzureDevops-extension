### NuKeeper AzureDevops Extension

This is the [NuKeeper](https://github.com/NuKeeperDotNet/NuKeeper) for [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/) / VSTS extension. It will allow you to run the NuKeeper command inside the users build pipeline.

You will find it [here in the Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nukeeper.nukeeper).

It's up to the user to schedule the pipeline in whatever is correct for their solution.
